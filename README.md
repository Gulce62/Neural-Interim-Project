# Neural-Interim-Project

All the algorithms were written from scratch without using any additional machine learning libraries. 

Question 1 – Autoencoder Neural Network --> The question's fundamental purpose is to implement an autoencoder neural network with a single hidden layer to extract features from natural images via unsupervised learning. A cost function being a combination of 3 terms is utilized. The first term is the average squared error between the prediction and the ground truth, the second one is the Tykhonov regularization that will be used to regularize all weights with a λ term and the third one is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence that will be used in hidden layers.

Question 2 – NLP Neural Network --> In this question an NLP neural network is implemented according to the desired form to predict the fourth word when the first three words are given. The form consists of an embedding layer, some logistic hidden units, and a softmax output layer. 

Question 3 – Time Series Classification --> Time series classification needed to be achieved by RNN and LSTM algorithms.
